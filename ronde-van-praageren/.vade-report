## Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for this Next.js App Router project.

### Changes Made:

1. **Package Installation**
   - Installed `@vercel/analytics` version 1.6.1 using npm
   - Updated package.json to include the new dependency
   - Updated package-lock.json with the new package and its dependencies

2. **Layout Configuration (src/app/layout.tsx)**
   - Added import: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next";`
   - Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag after `{children}`
   - Preserved all existing code structure, imports, metadata, and JSON-LD schema

### Implementation Details:

The Analytics component was added to the root layout file following Next.js App Router best practices:
- Placed at the end of the body tag to ensure it loads after the main content
- Uses the Next.js-specific import path `@vercel/analytics/next` for automatic optimization
- No configuration required - the component will automatically detect the Vercel environment

### Verification Steps Completed:

✅ Build completed successfully with no errors
✅ Linter passed with no warnings or errors  
✅ All existing functionality preserved
✅ TypeScript types validated

### Files Modified:

- `package.json` - Added @vercel/analytics dependency
- `package-lock.json` - Updated with new package and dependencies
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added Analytics import and component

The implementation follows Vercel's official documentation and Next.js best practices. Analytics will automatically start collecting data when deployed to Vercel.
