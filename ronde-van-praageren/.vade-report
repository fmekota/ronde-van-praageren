# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation Report

## Summary
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Speed Insights for Next.js 15.2.8 with App Router.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/speed-insights@^1.3.1` as a production dependency
- Used npm (the project's package manager) to install the package
- Updated `package-lock.json` to reflect the new dependency

### 2. Component Integration
Modified `src/app/layout.tsx`:
- Added import statement: `import { SpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/next"`
- Added `<SpeedInsights />` component inside the `<body>` tag, right after the existing `<Analytics />` component

## Implementation Details

Since this project uses:
- Next.js version 15.2.8 (well above the 13.5+ requirement)
- App Router architecture
- A root layout file at `src/app/layout.tsx`

I followed the recommended approach for Next.js 13.5+ with App Router:
1. Imported from `@vercel/speed-insights/next` (not from `/react`)
2. Added the component as a simple `<SpeedInsights />` without any props
3. Placed it in the root layout's `<body>` tag alongside the existing Analytics component

## Verification

All verification steps completed successfully:
- ✅ Dependencies installed via npm
- ✅ Build completed successfully with no errors
- ✅ Linter passed with no warnings or errors
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Files Modified

1. `package.json` - Added @vercel/speed-insights dependency
2. `package-lock.json` - Updated to include new dependency and its sub-dependencies
3. `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added SpeedInsights import and component

## Notes

- The SpeedInsights component is now placed right after the Analytics component for consistency
- The component will automatically track Core Web Vitals and other performance metrics when deployed to Vercel
- No additional configuration is required; the component works out of the box with Next.js App Router
- The implementation preserves all existing code structure and functionality
